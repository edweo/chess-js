# Chess-JS

This project is the result of me for the first time trying to learn JS and DOM manipulation.

Features:
- **Moving Pieces (some bugs will exist in some situations regarding legal moves)**
- **Sound Effects**
- **Timer (but no effect when running out)**
- **Castling**
- **Checking (there are still many bugs regarding checking the king)**
- **En Passant**
- **Responsive Design (Desktop/Mobile)**
- **Material Difference Tracker (shows which player has more captured pieces score)**
- **Rotating Board (2 players can play on the same screen)**

In the end, the project got too complex and was left in a buggy state. I was happy with the experience gained from trying to work with the DOM and programatically use JS.

**The code needs serious refactoring and does not follow good coding practices. I also did not know that JS had concepts such as events and other features which I could have used in this project.**
